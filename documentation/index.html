                                            The progress bar indicates the total progression of the project. To generate this progress bar, we calculate the total completed and non-completed tasks. The tasks points are important to calculate the progression.
                                            <br>
                                            Example: If there are 10 tasks with 1 point in each tasks, the project's total point will be 10.
                                            Whenever 5 of the tasks gets completed (Task status = Done), the total progress of the project will be (5*100)/10 = 50%.

                                            Same logic applied on the milestone progress bar.
