Dropzone.js is a light weight JavaScript library that turns an HTML element into a dropzone.
This means that a user can drag and drop a file onto it, and the file gets uploaded to the server via AJAX.

~~This is no longer the official repository for Dropzone. I have switched to [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/meno/dropzone)
as the primary location to continue development.~~

Don't be angry with me, but I've realised that GitHub is the better home for this library. I'm in the process of migrating back, and
making a few changes to the way continuous integration and publishing works.

I'm also making some changes on how issues and pull requests will be handled an am hoping to get a better grip on things.
